South Carolinian portrait artist Austin Hunt is a bit of a computer geek, working full time as a developer and pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science with goals of finding a career in tech that solders together the wires of the art and software worlds. He finds that drawing faces is the perfect complement to a life otherwise defined fully by software and web development; sometimes when you're running into problems it's necessary to clear your cache and refresh the page. He finds that sketchbooks help with that.
